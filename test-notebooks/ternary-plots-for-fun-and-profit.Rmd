## Archetypal Analysis [@Eugster2009]
* Goal:
    - Dimensionality reduction
    - Reduce a dataset with 17 box score metrics to three archetypes
    - Represent players' skills in terms of the archetypes
* Inputs:
    - Player box scores for the season (2016-17 to date)
    - About 450 players
* Outputs:
    - Archetype table
    - Player table

## The Three Archetypes
* Weighted box score metrics
* Each archetype represents a skill set
    - Front: skills for a frontcourt player (Center, Power Forward, Small Forward)
        - dominated by rebounds
    - Back: skills for a backcourt player (Point Guard, Shooting Guard) 
        - dominated by three-point shots
    - Bench: the "bad" archetype - players with low overall skills

## The Player Table
* For each player, the percentage of a player's skill in each archetype
* Total of Front, Back and Bench for each player is 1.0
* Sum of Front and Back represents Overall skill
* The archetypal player is the one with the largest value for the archetype
* So who are the archetypal players?

## Top Twelve Backcourt
```{r echo=FALSE}
top_back <- player_table %>% 
  dplyr::top_n(num_players, Back) %>% 
  dplyr::arrange(desc(Back))
(top_back %>% dplyr::select(-Bench)) %>% display_table()
```

## Top Twelve Frontcourt
```{r echo=FALSE}
top_front <- player_table %>% 
  dplyr::top_n(num_players, Front) %>% 
  dplyr::arrange(desc(Front))
(top_front %>% dplyr::select(-Bench)) %>% display_table()
```

## Top Twelve Overall #BallIsLife
```{r echo=FALSE}
top_overall <- player_table %>% 
  dplyr::top_n(num_players, Overall) %>% 
  dplyr::arrange(desc(Overall))
(top_overall %>% dplyr::select(-Bench)) %>% display_table()
```

## Ternary Plots [@Hamilton2016]
"A ternary plot, ternary graph, triangle plot, simplex plot, or de Finetti diagram is a barycentric plot on three variables which sum to a constant. It graphically depicts the ratios of the three variables as positions in an equilateral triangle. " - <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ternary_plot>

* But that's exactly what each entry in the player table is!
    - Three variables - Front, Back and Bench - that sum to a constant 1.0.
* So we can plot players as points on a ternary plot.

## Top Twelve Backcourt
```{r echo=FALSE}
ternary_plot(
  player_table = top_back, 
  plot_title = "NBA Top Twelve Backcourt", 
  top_label = "Back", 
  left_label = "Front") %>% print()
```

## Top Twelve Frontcourt
```{r echo=FALSE}
ternary_plot(
  player_table = top_front, 
  plot_title = "NBA Top Twelve Frontcourt", 
  top_label = "Back", 
  left_label = "Front") %>% print()
```

## Top Twelve Overall #ThisIsWhyWePlay
```{r echo=FALSE}
ternary_plot(
  player_table = top_overall, 
  plot_title = "NBA Top Twelve Overall", 
  top_label = "Back", 
  left_label = "Front") %>% print()
```

## Portland Trail Blazers #RipCity
```{r echo=FALSE}
blazers <- player_table %>% 
  dplyr::filter(Team == "Portland") %>% 
  dplyr::top_n(num_players, Overall) %>% 
  dplyr::arrange(desc(Overall))
(blazers %>% dplyr::select(-Bench)) %>% display_table()
```

## Portland Trail Blazers
```{r echo=FALSE}
ternary_plot(
  player_table = blazers, 
  plot_title = "Portland Trail Blazers", 
  top_label = "Back", 
  left_label = "Front") %>% print()
```

## Pop Quiz!
1. Who is the archetypal backcourt player?
2. Who is the archetypal frontcourt player?
3. Who are the three best Trail Blazers?
