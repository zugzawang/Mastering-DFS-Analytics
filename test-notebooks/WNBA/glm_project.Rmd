## Build model
```{r}
model_input <- playerbox %>% filter(fdfp >= 0)
glm_model <- glm(
  fdfp ~ player_full_name + opp_team + venue_r_h,
  data = model_input,
  family = quasipoisson
)
glm_tidy <- broom::tidy(glm_model) %>% 
  dplyr::filter(p.value <= 0.05) %>%
  dplyr::arrange(desc(estimate))
```

## Run the predictions
```{r}
fd_missing <- fd_salaries %>% 
  anti_join(playerbox, by = c("Nickname" = "player_full_name"))
aug_fd_salaries <- fd_salaries %>% 
  semi_join(playerbox, by = c("Nickname" = "player_full_name")) %>%
  left_join(decoder, by = c("Team" = "fanduel")) %>%
  left_join(decoder, by = c("Opponent" = "fanduel")) %>%
  rename(
    player_full_name = Nickname,
    own_team = bigdataball.x,
    opp_team = bigdataball.y,
    venue_r_h = Venue)
aug_fd_salaries <- aug_fd_salaries %>%
  mutate(
    projection = round(predict(glm_model, newdata = aug_fd_salaries, type = "response"), 2),
    value = round(1000 * projection / Salary, 2),
    delta = round(projection - FPPG, 2)
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(delta))
View(aug_fd_salaries)
```
